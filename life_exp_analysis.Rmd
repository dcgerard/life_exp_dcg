# Abstract

Here, we will examine the famous relationship between time and maximum life expectancy as observed in Oeppen and Vaupel (2002).

# Analysis

Loads the data
```{r}
library(gapminder)
data("gapminder_unfiltered")
gapminder_unfiltered
```

Calculate maximum
```{r}
gapminder_unfiltered %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  filter(lifeExp == max(lifeExp)) %>%
  arrange(year) %>%
  ungroup() ->
  maxdf
```
